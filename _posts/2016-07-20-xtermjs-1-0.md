Today we are excited to announce the availability of **<a href="https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js" target="_blank">xterm.js 1.0</a>**! Xterm.js is the open source terminal component that lies behind [SourceLair](https://www.sourcelair.com)’s terminal since 2014.

## Great features

Xterm.js is a fully featured terminal emulator based on VT100 terminal with lots of amazing features, the most important of which are listed below:

- Full support for text-based applications (e.g. ls, git, etc.)
- Full support for curses-based applications (e.g. vim, tmux, etc.)
- Mouse event support for terminal applications
- International character support, including CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) characters
- Modular API that supports add-ons

## Products built with xterm.js

Besides [SourceLair](https://www.sourcelair.com), xterm.js is being used as the terminal component for a few wonderful applications like the following.

### <a href="http://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft Visual Studio Code</a>

Since June 2016 the integrated terminal of Microsoft Visual Studio Code is based on xterm.js. Visual Studio Code is a free and open source code editor by Microsoft, which is built completely on web technologies and is already used by millions of developers world wide. We are really proud to mention that we have worked a lot with Microsoft and more particularly with <a href="https://github.com/Tyriar" target="_blank">Daniel Imms</a> on improving xterm.js. We have received great stellar Pull Requests from them which makes Microsoft our biggest external contributor of xterm.js to date.

### <a href="http://jupyter.org/" target="_blank">Jupyter Notebook</a>

Since May 2016 the terminal of Jupyter Notebook’s JavaScript UI is powered by xterm.js. The Jupyter Notebook is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text, which is also very popular in the Python community. We are excited that Jupyter uses xterm.js and really grateful for the contributions we received from its team.

### <a href="https://gitlab.com" target="_blank">GitLab</a>

GitLab ported xterm.js to CoffeeScript to improve its terminal emulation. GitLab is free and open source software that provides Git repository management, code reviews, issue tracking, activity feeds and wikis.
