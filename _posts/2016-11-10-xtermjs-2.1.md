Today we are announcing **<a href="https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js" target="_blank">xterm.js 2.1</a>**! Below you can find some of the most important updates of this release.

## ðŸ†• All-new scrolling API
In addition to line scrolling, we are introducing a few higher level methods, that give you finer-grained control on how much you want to scroll:

- [`scrollPages(n)`](/docs/api/Terminal/#scrollpagesn): Scrolls viewport down by `n` pages (or scrolls up if `n` is negative)
- [`scrollToTop()`](/docs/api/Terminal/#scrolltotop): Scrolls the terminal to the top of the buffer
- [`scrollToBottom()`](/docs/api/Terminal/#scrolltobottom): Scrolls the terminal to the bottom of the buffer.

## ðŸ†• Terminado addon
In this release we included a new [Terminado](http://terminado.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) addon. Terminado exposes back-end terminals via a WebSocket protocol. To learn how you can hook an xterm.js front-end to a Terminado back-end take a look at our [Connecting to Terminado](/docs/guides/terminado/) guide or at the source code of the [`terminado`](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/blob/2.1.0/addons/terminado/terminado.js) addon.

## IME improvements
We bundled multiple improvements to our IME support in this release, as it is one of xterm.js' most important features. In more details:

- Hidden textarea is correctly positioned when IME is inactive ([#301](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/301))
- The composition view is always correctly sized and positioned ([#320](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/320))
- IME position is correct and stabilized when active ([#323](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/323))

## Right-click, copy and paste improvements
Getting right-click and clipboard manipulation right across all major browser is a tough task. In this release we made some great progress towards this, with the following updates:

- Fix right-click when no selection has been instantiated ([#332](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/332))
- Fix copy and paste on Internet Explorer ([#339](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/339), [#334](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/334))
- Provide right-click copy and paste on all browsers ([#342](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/342), [#345](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/345))
