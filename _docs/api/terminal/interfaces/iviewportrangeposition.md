## Properties

###  x

• **x**: *number*

*Defined in [xterm.d.ts:1067](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/blob/4.4.0/typings/xterm.d.ts#L1067)*

The x position of the cell. This is a 0-based index that refers to the
space in between columns, not the column itself. Index 0 refers to the
left side of the viewport, index `Terminal.cols` refers to the right side
of the viewport. This can be thought of as how a cursor is positioned in
a text editor.

###  y

• **y**: *number*

*Defined in [xterm.d.ts:1073](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/blob/4.4.0/typings/xterm.d.ts#L1073)*

The y position of the cell. This is a 0-based index that refers to a
specific row.
